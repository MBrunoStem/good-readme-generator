# README Generator

## Description
To generate a professional README via the command line.
        
## User Story
AS a Developer
I want to quickly and easily generate a README file for my projects
SO that I can spend more time coding

WHEN I type 'node index.js' in the command line
THEN I am prompted with a series of questions
WHEN I submit all my responses
THEN a README is created in the 'output' folder
WHEN I view the README
THEN I see a Title, Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, Licensing, Contribution    Guidelines, Test Instructions, and Questions
WHEN I view the Title
THEN I see a Badge that corresponds to the License I selected
WHEN I view the Table of Contents
THEN they should have links to the other sections
WHEN I view the Description, Installation, Usage, Licensing, Contribution Guidelines, Test Instructions, and Questions sections
THEN the answers I input during the prompt are displayed underneath the title of each section
WHEN I view the Questions section
THEN I see a link to my GitHub profile, my email address, and my preferred method of contact
